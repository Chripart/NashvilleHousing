# NashvilleHousing

We begin this project with some data cleaning to prepare our database for Tableau.

Data Cleaning:
-Standardize the date format
-Populate missing Address data from the surrounding data
-Breaking all the adresses in Address,City,State
-Changing all single letter data to their full counterparts
-Removed Duplicates

The Tableau Dashboard includes:
-A line graph that illustrates the correlation between the year of construction of houses and their corresponding sale prices
-A line graph that illustrates the correlation between the sale date and sale price of the house
-A map that displays the distribution of sold houses across the cities, indicating the quantity of houses sold in each location
-A barplot of the quantity of house sold based on the number of bedrooms
